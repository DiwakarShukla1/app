But no necrotic spots are observed on the veins.","The roots and stem become abnormally long and develop woodiness.","The fruits do not mature fully and remain light green in colour. The forage crops contain undesirably wide C:N ratio and thus have lower nutritive value."],Quick_Facts:["The plants frequently contain more Sulphur than Potassium, Calcium and Magnesium.","Sulphur improves cereal qualities for milling and baking, marketability of copra, quality of tobacco, vegetables, onion, crucifers (cabbage, cauliflower, knol-khol, mustard), legumes, forage crops, etc. Obviously, if crop rotation is followed with these crops; the next crop requires addition of Sulphur in the field.","Rains, industrial fumes, smokes, decaying organic matter, etc. return some amount of Sulphur in soil and air.","Thawing cabbage fields emit Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) gas. This is an evidence of abundant Sulphur content in cole crops. Onion and Garlic also contain Sulphur in appreciable quantities. Their pungency is due to presence of sulphurous compound – Allyl Propyl di Sulphide.","It is absorbed in the plant system as Sulphate form (SO4). Then it goes into the production of Sulphur containing amino acids like Cystine, Methionine, etc. Just like Nitrates (NO3) are reduced before they can be used to form proteins, Sulphates must also be reduced to become a part of Sulphur containing organic compounds in the plant.","Sulphur deficiency is found mainly in acidic soil. So also in coarse textured soils low in organic matter, in high rainfall areas and sites away from industrial activity.","Optimum supply of Sulphur leads to increased uptake of Manganese and Zinc."],title:"SULPHUR"},{Causes_of_Deficiency:["Sandy or coarse textured, calcareous, cold and wet soils.

Therefore its place in Indian agriculture in terms of nutrient constraints is next only to Nitrogen and Phosphorus.","Zinc deficiencies are mainly related to reduced root growth and activity as well as lower microbial activity which further decreases Zinc release from soil organic matter. Zinc uptake by plant decreases with increased soil pH. Uptake of Zinc also is adversely affected by high levels of available Phosphorus and Iron in soils.","Rhizoctonia Root Rot, Fusarium Wilt and Zinc: Zinc application does not directly inhibit the infection, nor reduce its pathogenicity, but it does strongly increase the growth of the plant. The net result is that Zinc sufficient plants show an increased tolerance to the root pruning effect of the fungus. The plant roots lacking in Zinc would get leaky membranes, thus attracting even more fungal hyphae due to root exudation of phytosiderophores, sugars, phenolics, amino acids and other organic compounds. Zinc deficient plants are more susceptible to Fusarium Wilt.
